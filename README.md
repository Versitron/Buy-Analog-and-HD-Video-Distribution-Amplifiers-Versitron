## What Are Video Distribution Amplifiers?

Video distribution amplifiers replicate a single video signal across multiple outputs without degradation. Analog and HD versions maintain signal integrity over long cable runs, making them ideal for surveillance systems, control rooms, and professional AV setups.

Buyers typically purchase video distribution amplifiers to:
- distribute HD or analog video to multiple monitors simultaneously  
- split video signals from cameras, recorders, or media sources  
- integrate video across large-scale surveillance, broadcast, or industrial setups
